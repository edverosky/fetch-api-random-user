# Fetch API Demo

## Functionality
Need a front end for an API? This is a no-frills example of collecting data from a popular 3rd-party testing API, the Random User Generator. This demo loads up a set of random people and displays them in a list. Use the select box to load up 3, 5, or 10 random users.

## Development
The Random User Generator provides a simple API with data provided in various formats, including JSON (featuring nested objects). This project simply demonstrates the fetching and displaying of that data. First, a simple static design was created in HTML/CSS. That design was then ported over to JSX in React. This design uses functional components only, and Axios for fetching the data.

## Process

1) Get field examples from source.
2) Create static example of field presentation in HTML/CSS (Bootstrap for speed).
3) Create static example of field presentation in React.
4) Develop dynamic (calls to api), components, etc. in React.
